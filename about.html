           <h1>About us</h1>
           <h1>The Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG 6x6 pickup is an extreme off-road version of the conventional Gelendvagen, 
               based on three-axle military vehicles.
               The six-wheeled SUV is equipped with a 5.5-liter V8 petrol engine with two turbines producing 544 hp. 
               with. Paired with this power unit is a seven-speed "automatic". With this "set" the car accelerates 
               to a hundred in six seconds, and its maximum speed is electronically limited to 160 km / h.
            </h1>
            <h1>The Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG 6 Ã— 6 has permanent all-wheel drive with all five differential locks. He 
                also has a downshift. Naturally, the appetites of this giant weighing 3.8 tons are very impressive 
                - about 22 liters per 100 km. As conceived by the Germans, the third axle, firstly, reduces the 
                pressure of the wheels on the ground (due to this, the car will sink into snow or mud less), and 
                secondly, it improves the geometric cross-country ability (the six-wheeled Gelendvagen has a departure 
                angle twice as large, than the usual SUVs - 54 degrees against the usual 27) and, thirdly, improves 
                directional stability.
